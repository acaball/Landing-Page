Man oh man, this was fun BUT I struggled with fitting everything evenly. One thing I couldnt figure out is having my first section containers level, so being at the same location. Also I am not sure how my shrinking is supposed to look but my final image seems spot on. 

I used a photo by Skyler Sion in this project. The photo is titled "Silhoutte of Trees during Sunset". I got it from pexels.com. So thank you for the amazing photo Skyler!
